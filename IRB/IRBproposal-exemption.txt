2. Provide an Abstract or Summary for the proposed study.
In an existing group study course ESP 198/Geo 298, students each week will pick from a list of 3-4 similar software applications. They will spend 2-3 hours learning to use the software and then write a short review and score their experience with the software via a standard list of questions.

3. Describe the specific aims/purpose.
To provide information for improving the software used in the Course and identify which software may be better suited for demonstrating a particular topic in future courses.

OSGeo Live is a collection of Free and Open Source software specifically in the geospatial field, it is provided free of charge to anyone in the world via the internet and is liberally licensed to allow end users to do whatever they want with it. The design of the OSGeo Live is such that users need not install software but can just test/demo/train directly from the downloaded DVD(link). It has potential use a computer based teaching platform prebuilt by the community but accessible by any instructor. Feedback previously has been via a public mailing list. There is a need for more structured testing in the classroom, as prior uses are typically 1/2-1 day workshops at conferences. Knowledge gained will be directly used to improve future iterations of the course and general feedback will be provided to the OSGeo Live project to improve future version of the product.

5. Describe the research methods and procedures.
Each week, students will fill out a standard review form, electronically.
