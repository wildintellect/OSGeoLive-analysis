	Researchers have identified the financial, temporal, and experience and skills barriers
that can impede access to and use of GIS and digital data by resource poor organizations
and social groups (Weiner et al. 1995, Sawicki and Craig 1996, Barndt 1998, Craig and
Elwood 1998). 

	For these groups, the most valuable function of GIS
is not its spatial analysis capabilities, but the capacity to experiment with spatial repre-
sentations and produce visual texts to support shifting portrayals of community space
and needs. Other participatory GIS projects have illustrated how GIS may function as a
conflict mediator in contentious community decision making, as groups examine different
spatial scenarios and representations (Kyem 2004a). In this instance, the visualization
capabilities of GIS are again central, along with the capacity to model multiple scenarios
and outcomes. While some participatory GIS initiatives mirror other kinds of GIS applica-
tions, there are many that are quite different and we need to continue to include these
diverse applications in our efforts to unpack the full range of ways that GIS is used in
the production of knowledge and power.
