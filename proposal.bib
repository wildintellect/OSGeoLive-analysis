	in a community engaged in a ten-year revitalization effort. Working
	with several youth-serving organizations, a community planning project
	was conducted in which local youth collected qualitative data about
	their neighborhood through a variety of techniques (photography,
	drawings, narratives). The project took place against the backdrop
	of an emerging neighborhood indicators geographical information system
	{(GIS)} aimed at tracking the impact of the revitalization effort.
	Although techniques for collecting and using qualitative data have
	matured during several decades of use in the field of participatory
	planning and development, their effective incorporation into {GIS}
	remains elusive. Although few technical barriers remain, the absence
	of stakeholder participation and the lack of community capacity to
	implement a community-based {GIS} are important obstacles to a fully
	realized qualitative {GIS.} Drawing on the youth-development literature,
	I demonstrate in this case study the potential of qualitative {GIS}
	for engaging young people in participatory planning, while also highlighting
	the continuing challenge to its implementation.},

	of spatial data quality is a clear challenge. The data that are contributed
	to {VGI} projects do not comply with standard spatial data quality
	assurance procedures, and the contributors operate without central
	coordination and strict data collection frameworks. However, similar
	to the area of open source software development, it is suggested
	that the data hold an intrinsic quality assurance measure through
	the analysis of the number of contributors who have worked on a given
	spatial unit. The assumption that as the number of contributors increases
	so does the quality is known as {‘Linus’} Law’ within the open source
	community. This paper describes three studies that were carried out
	to evaluate this hypothesis for {VGI} using the {OpenStreetMap} dataset,
	showing that this rule indeed applies in the case of positional accuracy.},

	their utility for landscape ecology research. We also provide a summary
	of related landscape analysis {FOSS} applications, and extensions.
	Our results indicate that (i) all eight {GIS} provide the basic {GIS}
	functionality needed in landscape ecology, (ii) they all facilitate
	customisation, and (iii) they all provide good support via forums
	and email lists. Drawbacks that have been identified are related
	to the fact that most projects are relatively young. This currently
	affects the size of their user and developer communities, and their
	ability to include advanced spatial analysis functions and up-to-date
	documentation. However, we expect these drawbacks to be addressed
	over time, as systems mature. In general, we see great potential

	community towards a common, customisable and free research platform.},

  abstract = {Geo-spatial information is important for a variety of decisionmaking,
	planning, marketing, and development activities. Yet, in the developing
	world, there are significant challenges to collecting this data,
	including poor network infrastructure, the lack of availability and
	trained operators of hand-held devices, and the difficulty in finding
	specialists who can effectively organize spatial data. This project
	explores the possibility of using a simpler {GIS} data collection
	methodology – annotating paper maps – in order to both simplify the
	data collection process, and capture more qualitative data. Through
	interviews, prototyping, and testing, we hope to design a viable
	proof of concept that can both support existing {GIS} data collection
	efforts, and lower the barrier to entry for additional organizations
	to collect geo-spatial data and conducting analyses.},

  abstract = {Endogenous growth theory places spatial knowledge spillovers at the
	center of national technological progress. Advances in spatial autocorrelation
	and regression analyses provide methods to assess the influence of
	these spillovers on the geographical distribution and growth of invention.
	This article investigates interstate inequality and convergence in
	per capita patenting in the United States in the period 1963–2003.
	We analyze both the complete forty years and trends in ten-year intervals.
	Moran's I reveals spatial dependence in patenting levels and growth,
	and {LISA} cluster maps identify regional groupings of leading and
	trailing states. Our regression results show that both regional effects
	and spatial spillovers influence convergence rates, which were low
	and steady in the thirty years before 1993. In the subsequent decade,
	patenting expansion concentrated in a few states, inequality increased,
	and divergence ensued. Western states, in general, and the Pacific
	Northwest, in particular, increasingly dominate patent growth. Rank
	order correlation analyses show that convergence before 1993 was
	driven by catch-up and not by leapfrogging. A final regression analysis
	shows that patent growth rates in the 1993–2003 interval were higher
	in more rural states and in those with high proportions of payrolls
	generated by high-technology manufacturing and producer services
	industries. States in the South significantly lagged. Our results
	support the hypothesis that creative skilled professionals seek to
	reside in states that offer both well-paying jobs in high-technology
	manufacturing and producer services sectors and easy access to rural
	outdoor recreation and leisure amenities.},
